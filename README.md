# ConVarT_matchVar_analysis
This repo contains pipeline to generate variant tables used in ConVarT website (www.convart.org) and matchVar tables including all matching variants.

To run the pipeline, run the code below:

```
chmod -x run_scripts.sh
./run_scripts.sh
```
Note that executing the pipeline may take a long time. So it is recommended to run the script line by line.
